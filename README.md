## Folder struct
Each folder contains the solution for the excerse, which has the same name.
## Note for A3
A3 contants a makefile and plot.py for plot the data. When you run 
```
make
```
in Linux or Unix-like OS (e.g. macOS) you will have plot.png in the same folder. 
For MS windows, make may not works.
